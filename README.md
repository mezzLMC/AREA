# AREA Project

Build in two months during as a third year project at EPITECH, the **AREA project** is a software suite designed to function similarly to IFTTT and Zapier. It allows users to automate tasks by creating workflows that connect different applications and services seamlessly.

The true point of the project is how easy it is to encapsulate and add a new service to the project for any begginer/intermediate developer thanks to a great architecture and a good documentation.

## Tech stack

### The project is divided into 4 units:
- **Front-end**: The user interface of the application, built with React in Next.js.
- **Mobile app**: A mobile application built with React Native.
- **REST API**: Format, validate, and process requests from the front-end to database and service worker.
- **Service worker**: Communicates with external services, performs frequent checks (polling), detects actions and triggers reactions.

### Advantages of a Typescript-only codebase:

- As C/C++ devs, a typped langages was a must have for us.
- As a team of 4, it was easier to understand each other's code and get help from each other when needed.
- A shared library of types, interfaces, and models was created to ensure consistency across the codebase.
