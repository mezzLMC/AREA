In this section, you can manage and update your personal information as well as disconnect from registered services. Keeping your profile up-to-date ensures a better experience within the AREA application.

## A. Edit Information

Using the corresponding form, you can edit your personal information, which includes:

- **Username**: Update your display name within the application.
- **Email**: Change your registered email address for account verification and notifications.
- **Password**: Set a new password for added security. Make sure to choose a strong password that meets the security requirements.

### Steps to Edit Your Information

1. **Fill Out the Form**: Enter your new username, email, and password in the provided fields.
2. **Submit Changes**: Click the "Save Changes" button to update your information. Make sure all fields are correctly filled out to avoid any errors.
3. **Confirmation**: You will receive a confirmation message once your information has been successfully updated.

## B. Disconnect from Services

If you wish to disconnect from any of the services you are registered with, you can easily do so from this page.

### Steps to Disconnect

1. **View Connected Services**: Check the list of services you are currently connected to.
2. **Select a Service**: Choose the service you wish to disconnect from.
3. **Confirm Disconnection**: Click the "Disconnect" button next to the selected service. A confirmation prompt will appear to ensure you want to proceed.
4. **Successful Disconnection**: Once disconnected, you will no longer receive triggers or reactions from that service.

### Important Notes

- Disconnecting from a service will remove access to any associated triggers and reactions within your AREAs.
- Ensure that you really want to disconnect, as this action cannot be undone without re-registering for the service.

By regularly updating your personal information and managing your service connections, you can optimize your experience with the AREA application and make sure it aligns with your current preferences!
