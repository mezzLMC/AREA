The AREA application integrates seamlessly with Discord, allowing you to automate interactions and enhance your workflow. Below are the actions and reactions you can set up for your Discord service.

## Actions

These are the triggers that initiate the automation:

- **Message Sent**: Activate the automation when a message is sent in a specific channel. This allows you to respond promptly to relevant conversations.
  
- **Direct Message Received**: Trigger an action when a direct message (DM) is received. This is useful for personal notifications or direct communication with users.

## Reactions

Once an action is triggered, you can choose from the following reactions:

- **Trigger a Webhook**: Automatically send data to a specified endpoint, enabling seamless integration with other services or applications.

- **React with a Specific Emoji**: Automatically react to a message with a designated emoji. This can be used for feedback or to indicate acknowledgment of a message.

- **Send a Message from Personal Account**: Send a message back to the channel or user from your personal account, allowing for direct interaction without manual input.
