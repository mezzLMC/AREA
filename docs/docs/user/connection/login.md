- **Email**: Enter your registered email address.
- **Password**: Type in your secure password.

## 2. Google Login

Alternatively, you can log in using your Google account. This option allows for quick access, and once connected, youâ€™ll be automatically logged in each time you visit the login page, unless you manually log out of the application.
